/**
 * <p>
 * Qualifier for a reference type in a {@link ElementType#TYPE_USE TYPE_USE} position: The type that has this annotation
 * is explicitly intended to include the value {@code null} at runtime.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * If annotation based {@code null} analysis is enabled, using this annotation has two consequences:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Binding a {@code null} value to an entity (field, local variable, method parameter, or method return value) of
 * this type is legal.</li>
 * <li>Dereferencing an expression of this type is unsafe, i.&thinsp;e., a {@code NullPointerException} can occur at
 * runtime.</li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note, some developer environment might come along with some annotation based {@code null} analysis.
